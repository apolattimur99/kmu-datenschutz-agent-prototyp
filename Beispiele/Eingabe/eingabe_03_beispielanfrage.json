    "free_text": "Hello, we are a mid-sized retail group with operations in Italy, Germany and Austria. We would like to introduce an internal AI assistant for our store managers and customer support teams. Our requirements: 1) Identification of suitable use cases in customer support and store operations, 2) a reference architecture that respects EU data protection requirements, 3) training sessions for approx. 40 store managers and 20 support agents, and 4) a 6-month support option to refine prompts, knowledge base and workflows. Our internal IT prefers a phased approach with an initial pilot in Germany. Budget: we estimate around 40,000–60,000 EUR for the first year, but we would appreciate a modular proposal.",
